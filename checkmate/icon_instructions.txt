To complete the extension, you need to add an icon.png file to this directory.

You can:
1. Create a simple 128x128 pixel PNG image
2. Download a free chess-related icon and rename it to icon.png
3. Use a placeholder icon from a site like https://icons8.com/

The icon should be placed in this directory with the filename "icon.png".
