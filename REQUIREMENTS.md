# Checkmate: Chess Improvement CLI Tool

## Project Overview

Checkmate is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to help chess players improve their game through AI-powered analysis of their Lichess games. The tool authenticates with the user's Lichess account, downloads their games to a local cache, and uses AI to analyze these games and provide personalized improvement suggestions.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Authentication

- **1.1** The CLI shall use the berserk Python library to authenticate with Lichess via OAuth.
- **1.2** The tool shall securely store authentication tokens locally for persistent access.
- **1.3** The tool shall provide a clear authentication flow that opens a browser window for the user to authorize the application.
- **1.4** The tool shall handle authentication errors gracefully with clear user feedback.
- **1.5** The tool shall provide a way to revoke authentication and remove stored tokens.

### 2. Game Data Retrieval

- **2.1** The tool shall download the user's chess games from Lichess in PGN format.
- **2.2** The tool shall support filtering games by:
  - **2.2.1** Time period (e.g., last week, last month, custom date range)
  - **2.2.2** Game format (e.g., bullet, blitz, rapid, classical)
  - **2.2.3** Color played (white, black, or both)
  - **2.2.4** Game result (win, loss, draw)
- **2.3** The tool shall display progress indicators during the download process.
- **2.4** The tool shall handle rate limiting from the Lichess API appropriately.

### 3. Local Game Cache

- **3.1** The tool shall store downloaded games in a local cache.
- **3.2** The cache shall be organized in a structured way (e.g., by date, format).
- **3.3** The tool shall avoid re-downloading games that are already in the cache unless explicitly requested.
- **3.4** The tool shall provide commands to manage the cache (view stats, clear cache, etc.).
- **3.5** The tool shall handle cache corruption gracefully.

### 4. AI Analysis

- **4.1** The tool shall use an AI agent to analyze the cached games.
- **4.2** The analysis shall identify patterns in the user's play, including:
  - **4.2.1** Common mistakes
  - **4.2.2** Missed tactical opportunities
  - **4.2.3** Opening repertoire strengths and weaknesses
  - **4.2.4** Endgame technique
  - **4.2.5** Time management patterns
- **4.3** The tool shall generate personalized improvement suggestions based on the analysis.
- **4.4** The tool shall provide different levels of analysis detail based on user preference.
- **4.5** The tool shall support analyzing specific subsets of games (e.g., only losses, only games with a specific opening).

### 5. Output and Reporting

- **5.1** The tool shall present analysis results in a clear, readable format in the terminal.
- **5.2** The tool shall support exporting analysis results to different formats (e.g., text, HTML, PDF).
- **5.3** The tool shall provide visualizations where appropriate (e.g., common mistake patterns).
- **5.4** The tool shall allow users to save and compare analyses over time to track improvement.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Dependencies

- **1.1** Python 3.10 or higher
- **1.2** Berserk library (v0.13.2 or higher) for Lichess API interaction
- **1.3** An appropriate AI/ML library for game analysis
- **1.4** Data storage solution for the local cache
- **1.5** Click package for command-line interface implementation

### 2. Performance

- **2.1** The tool shall handle large numbers of games efficiently.
- **2.2** The AI analysis shall complete within a reasonable time frame.
- **2.3** The tool shall use appropriate caching strategies to avoid redundant processing.

### 3. Security

- **3.1** The tool shall securely store authentication tokens.
- **3.2** The tool shall not transmit game data to third parties without explicit user consent.
- **3.3** The tool shall respect Lichess API terms of service.

### 4. Usability

- **4.1** The CLI shall provide clear help documentation accessible via `--help`.
- **4.2** The tool shall use color and formatting to enhance readability where appropriate.
- **4.3** The tool shall provide sensible default options for all commands.
- **4.4** The tool shall validate user input and provide helpful error messages.

## Implementation Considerations

### 1. Code Structure

- **1.1** The codebase shall follow a modular design with clear separation of concerns.
- **1.2** The authentication, game retrieval, caching, and analysis components shall be implemented as separate modules.
- **1.3** The code shall include comprehensive error handling.
- **1.4** The code shall be well-documented with docstrings and comments.
- **1.5** The command structure shall use Click's group and command decorators to organize functionality.
- **1.6** Business logic shall be separated from the CLI interface to enable future web interface development.

### 2. AI Implementation

- **2.1** The AI component shall be designed to be replaceable/upgradeable as better analysis techniques become available.
- **2.2** The initial implementation may use rule-based analysis combined with statistical methods.
- **2.3** Future versions may incorporate more advanced machine learning techniques.

### 3. Testing

- **3.1** The codebase shall include unit tests for all critical functionality.
- **3.2** The codebase shall include integration tests for the complete workflow.
- **3.3** The authentication flow shall be tested with mock Lichess API responses.

### 4. Command Structure

- **4.1** The CLI shall use the Click package to implement the command-line interface.
- **4.2** Commands shall be structured in a hierarchical manner using Click's group and command decorators.
- **4.3** Business logic shall be implemented in separate service classes that are independent of the CLI interface.
- **4.4** Command functions shall primarily handle:
  - **4.4.1** Parsing and validating user input
  - **4.4.2** Calling appropriate service methods
  - **4.4.3** Formatting and displaying output
- **4.5** Service classes shall be designed to be reusable in different interfaces (CLI, web, etc.).
- **4.6** Configuration and state management shall be handled in a way that can be accessed by both CLI and future web interfaces.

## Future Considerations

- Integration with chess engines for deeper tactical analysis
- Support for other chess platforms beyond Lichess
- Interactive training recommendations based on identified weaknesses
- Collaborative analysis features for coaches and students
- Web interface implementation that reuses the core service components
- API endpoints that mirror CLI commands for web interface integration
- Repository of historical games that demonstrate specific techniques or concepts to work on
